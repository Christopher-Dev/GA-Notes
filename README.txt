pop() removes the last item from a list

google everything!!!

Tuples are like lists but cant be ammended or remove items. they use () rather than [].
Use tuples for infor that wont change such as days of the week, days in a month, ect.

set are unordered lists and use {}. checking if something is in a set is faster than checking a list. 
Use the "in" statement for that.'what you looking for' in the_set_your_searching

Dictionary's also use {} brackets and an empty set show an empty dictionary.

Sets only contain unique identifieres.

if the next line of code is to be indented then use a colon.

for variable_name in collection:
    indented lineno()
    
#for - Introduces the for loop

#variable_name - Variable the loop operates

#in - Directs Python to the collection

#Collection - Any elemt that can be iterated over. For example, lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries (the keys), and sets (in no particular order).

# : - Ends the expression

# Indented line of code - What happens if the expression is true
